The range of possible scores is from 0 to 40 where
0 indicates an abstainer who has never had any problems from alcohol.
A score of 1 to 7 suggests low-risk consumption according to WHO guidelines.
Scores from 8 to 14 suggest hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption
and a score of 15 or more indicates the likelihood of alcohol dependence (moderate-severe alcohol use disorder).
